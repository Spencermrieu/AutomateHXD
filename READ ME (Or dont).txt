This script automates copying and pasting one cell of data to multiple cells below that one.

Load AutoHotkey with the Delete I-frames script running.
When you are ready to remove I-frames place your mouse pointer on the rectangular slider underneath the video.
Press the different key commands above for the amount of I-frames you want to remove to trigger the AutoHotkey script.
The script will then send the key commands needed to delete the requested number of frames.
Have fun moshing!
